/**
 * Module: `@app/api/v1/cognition/_bundle`
 * Purpose: Pure composition of the session-start kickstart bundle — the
 *   irreducible tooling invariants (code-owned) plus the markdown renderer
 *   that frames hub-delivered skills + domain pointers for a SessionStart hook.
 * Scope: Pure functions + the invariants constant. No I/O, no env, no container.
 * Invariants:
 *   - IRREDUCIBLE_INVARIANTS_ALWAYS_PRESENT: the constant is the one piece of
 *     cognition that must render even when the hub is empty/unreachable.
 *   - INDEX_FIRST: renders pointers (id + title + recall path), never full entry
 *     bodies. The ONE bounded exception is a single current-node orientation
 *     excerpt (the map an agent needs to start, not just the constitution) —
 *     capped at ORIENTATION_EXCERPT_MAX chars, one entry, never a full body.
 * Side-effects: none
 * Links: docs/spec/node-baas-architecture.md
 * @internal
